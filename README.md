# Bowhead Dev Challenge

## Smart Contract Info
This repo has everything needed to create a mobile dAPP to interact with a smart contract.
The contract source code is located [here](smart_contract/contracts/BowheadDevChallenge.sol) and the ABI can be found [here](smart_contract/build/contracts/BowheadDevChallenge.json).

The smart contract was deployed to the [Rinkeby](https://medium.com/@piyopiyo/list-of-ethereums-major-network-and-chain-ids-2bc58e928508) testnet.

This is the smart contract address:
0xc7c44c64DBddA29e2723FD1056ab876A54ef24CE

Please check the test cases [here](smart_contract/test/) to analyse how you can interact with the smart contract functions.

### Important Note!!
This smart contract is just for test purposes, it should not be used in a production environment.

- iOS: [Web3Swift](https://github.com/Boilertalk/Web3.swift)
- Web: [Web3](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.0/)
